# Testing

> [!NOTE]
> Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

I have conducted enough manual testing to and believe that the site works well. All sections like navbar buttons and booking page works well as expected. The images in the carousel also shows well and all other images are presented well. The website is intuitive for the user experience and users can easily see the service provided and click on the booking page when needed, the contact details in the footer section and the about us section and team members can be seen easily. 

## Code Validation

### HTML
Index HTML, Booking, and Workshop pages results are positive: 
- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://mairima.github.io/photography/index.html

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.
