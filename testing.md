# Testing

> [!NOTE]
> Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

I have conducted enough manual testing to and believe that the site works well. All sections like navbar buttons and booking page works well as expected. The images in the carousel also shows well and all other images are presented well. The website is intuitive for the user experience and users can easily see the service provided and click on the booking page when needed, the contact details in the footer section and the about us section and team members can be seen easily. 

## Code Validation

### HTML
Index HTML, Booking, and Workshop pages results are positive: 
- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://mairima.github.io/photography/index.html

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

| Gallery | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-gallery.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-gallery.png) |

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |
| Home | Feature is expected to display examples of why users should join. | Verified that the page displays the Firms mission and purpose in a clear and concise manner. | The mission and purpose were displayed as expected. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/home.png) |
| | Feature is expected to have accessible navigation links. | Checked navigation links for correct functionality and accessibility. | Navigation links were functional and accessible. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/navigation.png) |
| | Feature is expected to be fully responsive. | Resized the browser window and tested on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). | The page was responsive across all tested screen sizes. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/responsive.png) |
| Services | Feature is expected to display details of different services offered. | Verified that the page lists all services with relevant details. | Details were displayed as expected. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/events.png) |
| Workshop | Feature is expected to showcase a gallery of actual workshops and short description. | Verified that the Workshop contains clear images and text that aren't stretched, pixelated, and fully responsive. | Images are properly sized, and respond well to different device sizes. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/gallery.png) |
| Booking| Feature is expected to enforce valid input types for each field. | Entered invalid data (e.g., random text in an email field, numbers in a name field, etc.). | Error messages were displayed appropriately, and submission was blocked. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/signup02.png) |
| Social Links | Feature is expected to include working links to the clubâ€™s social platforms (Instagram, Facebook, etc.). | Clicked each social link to verify redirection to the correct platform page. | All links redirected to the correct platform pages, opening in new browser tabs. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/socialmedia.png) |
| 404 Error Page | Feature is expected to display a 404 error page for non-existent pages. | Navigated to an invalid URL (e.g., `/test`) to test error handling. | A custom 404 error page was displayed as expected. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/404.png) |
